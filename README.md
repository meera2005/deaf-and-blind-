# MEDICAL RECORD ANALYSER


## AIM

This project aims to develop a system that extracts essential data from medical reports and provides patients with information about their health conditions.

## FUNCTIONING

 The user can input a pdf file of their urine and blood sample report. The contents  in the report are extracted 
using Camelot library in python. The data extracted from the report are analysed using open ai and the required medical suggestions are delivered to the user.
The system will help patients to gain a better understanding of their health status, and healthcare professionals can use the system to save time and enhance the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment.

## STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT
The idea raised to our mind as we found one of out parents struggling to understand their blood and urine report and analyse every bit of it by searching in internet . 
We developed a python code to extract the data from pdf and used open AI to find suggestions . We finally made a front end using html and css and connected the python codes using flask .
Currently we are only able to analyse blood and urine samples and that also from tables only. In future we are planning to make necessary changes so that any kind of medical report can be accessed.
We are also planning to help user to analyse their health condition by individually giving their medical test results. We have made the initial design only. The very next step would be to work on it.
